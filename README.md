# Fiz

Fiz is a concept for a functional programming language. It is an exercise in designing a toy programming language. It's not a competitor to other serious functional languages, because fiz is probably not a very good language. I just wanted to put my ideas down somewhere. I cannot stress enough how dumb all this probably is.

Fiz is inspired mainly by Haskell and Ocaml.

All the design/syntax is work in progress. There is a WIP parser written in Ocaml using Menhir.
