# Fiz

Fiz is a concept for a functional programming language. It is an exercise in designing a toy programming language. It's not a competitor to other serious functional languages, because fiz is probably not a very good language. I just wanted to put my ideas down somewhere. I cannot stress enough how dumb all this probably is.

Fiz is inspired mainly by Haskell and Ocaml.

All the design/syntax is work in progress.

There is a WIP parser written in Ocaml using Menhir. My learning process for writing a parser was to look at examples and tutorials online, such as [Real World Ocaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html) and the [Programming Language Zoo](https://plzoo.andrej.com)
